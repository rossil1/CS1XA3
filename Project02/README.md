# Resume

Some key aspects that are mainly used to aid in naviagation of the website is a quicklink to the different nodes on the website.

A large portion of the work of this website was to make it look very nice with CSS. For what it's worth, I am capable of fullstake development, but I am more gifted in the backend portion than I am the front end.

The main resources I used to develope this page are:
	- https://www.w3schools.com/
	- https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/
	- https://www.colorcombos.com/
	- https://stackoverflow.com/
