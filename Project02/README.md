## Resume

Some key aspects that are mainly used to aid in naviagation of the website is a quicklink to the different nodes on the website.

A large portion of the work of this website was to make it look very nice with CSS. For what it's worth, I am capable of fullstake development, but I am more gifted in the backend portion than I am the front end.

The main resources I used to develope this page are:
	- https://www.w3schools.com/
	- https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/

## Project02 - Simon Says
The main purpose of this app is to give the player a chance to try to replicate a pattern
randomly gernerated by the web app in effor to maintain the longest chain.

When the user enters the game, there is a ready message asking the player to hit the spacebar to
show they are ready to begin.

In one of the many states of the game, when the player presses t=one of the 'w', 'a', 's', or 'd' keys a
respective button will be illuminated and record the players selection.

The app is then to check to see if user entered pattern matches the computer generated pattern, if it
does not the game will be ended and the user will be presented with their respective score.

<u>TODO:</u> The random number generated must be worked out, as at the moment the only functional portion
is the program recognizing a user response and accurately lighting up the proper button.

<u>TODO:</u> Look into troubleshooting elm -> html file conversion, as on Firefox it does not display as
it does on the elm reactor hosted across localhost.
